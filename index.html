                <h2>Plans & Projections</h2><br>
                <p>My plans are to have three very large protfolio projects by the time (or after) I am done with the Odin Project. These include a D&D Beyond Clone, a Youtube Clone, and possibly the revitalizing of The Corner Piece Dot Net. This is all in attempt to become skilled enough to be able to offer some real value in the market with my bit of programming knowledge. <br><br> Programming is, funamentally, information management. And as our vat of information becomes increasingly larger, more complex, convoluted, and difficult to navigate, the value of good information management increases. Also, as many of the tech giants have become corrupted and sick with self-destructive mind viruses, due to the steady collapse of the American dollar and the ending of the "Golden Age" of the American Empire: knowing <span class="italicSpan">what to do</span> with programming skill, may have more value than obtaining programming skill alone. <br><br>The ultimate goal of mine, then, is to build a team of people that can help, in some small way, with skillful information management, decision making, and excellent leadership: The inevitable economic and social collapse that threaten the survival of humanity itself. This may be achieved with the invention of new technologies, or simply with the proper maintaining of our current technologies.</p><br>
